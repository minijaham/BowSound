# BowSound

A simple recreation of Bow hit sound of Hypixel(Java)

## How to customise sound?

1. First, choose a sound from the list of Minecraft sounds [here](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/sound_list_pe.php).
2. Copy the name of the sound (eg. random.orb)
3. Assuming you have already installed the plugin, navigate to the server's `plugin-data` folder and find `BowSound`.
4. Then, open `config.yml` and paste the sound name after `bow-hit-sound`.

Example:<br />
```yaml
bow-hit-sound: "random.orb"
```

5. Save the file and restart the server.
6. Enjoy!
